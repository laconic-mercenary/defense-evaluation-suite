# Grading websqli-webshell-pivot by hand

The automated judge reads `AGENTS.md` directly and grades one rubric entry
at a time. To grade this case by hand in a chat, give a model `AGENTS.md`'s
guidance plus the inputs below, and ask for the output below.

## Inputs

- The AUT's answers: `QUESTION_ANSWERS.md` (provided alongside this file
  for each grading run)
- The questions asked: the case's `EXAM.md` (paired repo:
  `forensic-agent-tests/cases/websqli-webshell-pivot/EXAM.md`, or as
  pasted into this conversation)
- The true story: `BRIEFING.md` in this directory
- The scored rubric: `grading_schema.md` in this directory

## Output

Produce a per-question score (out of the schema's point value), a total
out of 100, and 2-3 sentences on whether the AUT correctly distinguished
the real breach from scan noise (Q2) and the real pivot from routine
backup traffic (Q4) using more than just "the numbers are bigger."
